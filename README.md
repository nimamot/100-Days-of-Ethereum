## 100 Days of Ethereum:

### Day 1: Introduction to Solidity

#### Understand what solidity is and its importance in blockchain development.

- Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms

#### Set up a development environment for Solidity.

- We can use Remix Ethereum IDE to develop smart contracts.

#### Write and deploy a simple smart contract on a local blockchain.

### Day 2–3: Solidity Basics

#### Learn Solidity data types, variables, operators, control structures (such as if statements and loops), and practice writing basic smart contracts for simple use cases.

- I will be using the following tutorial:

  - React commands using vite (all frontend stuff):

    - npm init vite@latest
    - npm install
    - npm run dev

    We'll also use tailwindcss for "building modern websites":

    - setup:
      - https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
        - npm install -D tailwindcss
        - npx tailwindcss init

  - Backend:
    - npm init -y : make an empty Json
    - installing react-icons and ether packages:
      - npm install react-icons ethers

### Day 4–7: Solidity Functions and Events

- Understand how to define and use functions in Solidity.
- Learn about function modifiers and fallback functions.
- Explore advanced topics like function overloading.
- Explore event handling and logging in Solidity.
- Build smart contracts with multiple functions and events.
