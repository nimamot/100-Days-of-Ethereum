## 100 Days of Ethereum:

### Day 1: Introduction to Solidity

#### Understand what solidity is and its importance in blockchain development.

- Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms

#### What is a smart contract?

- Smart contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.
- We can think of them as sets of instructions written in code instead of traditional pen and paper.
- Bitcoin is intentionally turning incomplete. Hence ETH is more commonly used for smart contracts.

#### What role does Chain Link play?

- Chain link allows for us to get Data and customize our smart contracts in any meaningful way.
- Chain Link is the most popular and powerful decentralized Oracle network.
- It can work on ETH, Avalanche, Polygon, Solana or any other blockchain.

#### What is the purpose of the smart contracts? what problem do they solve?

- They give rise to unbreakable promises since they are immutable, decentralized and transparent.

### Day 2: Dive deeper into the Blockchain world:

#### What is DeFi?

- Decentralized Finance
- Allow users to engage with finance and markets without having to go through a centralized intermediary.

#### What are DAOs?

- Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
- A type of bottom-up entity structure with no central authority. Members of a DAO own tokens of the DAO, and members can vote on initiatives for the entity. Smart contracts are implemented for the DAO, and the code governing the DAO's operations is publicly disclosed.

### Day 3: Solidity Basics

#### Learn Solidity data types, variables, operators, control structures (such as if statements and loops), and practice writing basic smart contracts for simple use cases.

#### Set up a development environment for Solidity.

- We can use Remix Ethereum IDE to develop smart contracts.

#### Write and deploy a simple smart contract on a local blockchain.

- I will be using the following tutorial:

### Day 4â€“7: Solidity Functions and Events

- Understand how to define and use functions in Solidity.
- Learn about function modifiers and fallback functions.
- Explore advanced topics like function overloading.
- Explore event handling and logging in Solidity.
- Build smart contracts with multiple functions and events.
