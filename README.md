## 100 Days of Ethereum:

### Day 1: Introduction to Solidity

#### Understand what solidity is and its importance in blockchain development.

- Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms

#### What is a smart contract?

- mart contracts are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary.
- We can think of them as sets of instructions written in code instead of traditional pen and paper.
- Bitcoin is intentionally turning incomplete. Hence ETH is more commonely used for smart contracts.

#### What role does Chain Link play?

- Chain link allows for us to get Data and customize our smart contracts in any meaningful way.
- Chain Link is the most popular and powerful decentralized Oracle network.
- It can work on ETH, Avalanche, Polugon, Solana or any other blockchain.

#### Set up a development environment for Solidity.

- We can use Remix Ethereum IDE to develop smart contracts.

#### What is the purpose of the smart contracts? what problem do they solve?

- They give rise to unbreakable promises since they are immutable, decentralized and transparent.

#### Write and deploy a simple smart contract on a local blockchain.

### Day 2–3: Solidity Basics

#### Learn Solidity data types, variables, operators, control structures (such as if statements and loops), and practice writing basic smart contracts for simple use cases.

- I will be using the following tutorial:

### Day 4–7: Solidity Functions and Events

- Understand how to define and use functions in Solidity.
- Learn about function modifiers and fallback functions.
- Explore advanced topics like function overloading.
- Explore event handling and logging in Solidity.
- Build smart contracts with multiple functions and events.
